description: Welcome to the Lodge, Hunter!
---

Hunters Lodge in this form got started at the start of 2025, but [me](https://www.twitch.tv/estoforshort){:target="\_blank"} and my broken code had already been known in the community a few years prior to that. The idea is simple: have a trophy leaderboard that you can scroll through and spot people you have either watched or interacted with across many different Twitch chats. That's the basics of it.

Displaying Twitch usernames instead of PSN is not the only thing that sets us apart from the other trophy leaderboards out there, though. We also take a few liberties on how we determine trophy values, so please don't expect your position to be up there just because you have a lot of platinum trophies. It's a bit more complicated than that.

## How are the trophy values determined?

Trophy values in our system are determined by their rarity. Each trophy starts life at their base value (Platinum is 300, Gold is 90, Silver is 30 and Bronze is 15 points) and it's downhill from there, as the value starts to drop based on it's unlock rates.

## How can I report an issue or suggest a change?

You can do that in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QYNsXnMMnA){:target="\_blank"}, by posting your issue in the issues channel.

## How can I contact you directly?

If there's no other direct communication line open between us, feel free to email me at <esto@hunterslodge.app>.
